    Hello! I am Thibault Félix de Valois, student at IESEG School of Management in Master and I am looking for a job opportunity of at least 6 months during a gap year from July 2020.
I decided to design this site so that you, as a recruiter, can better understand my personality and what drives me in 5 minutes!

    <h2> My journey <i class="fas fa-tasks"></i> </h2>
    <p>
 After a STI2D EE baccalaureate, a D.U.T Logistics and Transport Management as well as a double university degree in international technology education and a Bachelor in Business degree at the University of the West of Scotland in Glasgow, I chose to complete my master's degree  at the IESEG  School of Management specialty entrepreneurship.

Indeed, my different experiences within the Arkema group, 1ster French chemist enterprise, as an intern in the Purchasing Directorate and during my alternation on industrial sites, made me understand the value of obtaining managerial functions that your school would allow me to acquire.

After studying the various possibilities available to me in terms of higher education, the IESEG had a curriculum that gave me the chance to accomplish my professional project. The quality of the teaching and the variety of profiles that make up the faculty is a real asset to prepare me for the job of Business Developer.
In addition, the international dynamism of the school, a network of 235 foreign universities partners in 62 different countries, motivates even more my choice to join the IESEG.


In addition to my diploma in supply chain and purchasing, the training offered by the school, which combines theoretical courses, project, memory and internship in business, offers a solid background to work especially in the automotive sector or video games that I am passionate about.

I have a great ability to adapt and a strong motivation thanks to the sport I practiced in competition, whether it is tennis or football, which I will detail in the game my hobbies.
